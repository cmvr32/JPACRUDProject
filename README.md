## Lessons learned

This project helped solidify my understanding of the relationship/connections between the database, DAO, controller, entities and the jsp files.

Personally I realized that I learn best by doing. I learn very quickly the areas I am still struggling with when working on a project alone. I had to reach out for help a few times throughout this project. Working on my own helps me realize my areas of weakness, I then attempted to find solutions on my own and for those I couldn't was able to get support and further my understanding. 

Technically  I learned that so much can be learned from mistakes and how important it is to read the error messages to better understand what is breaking and why. I also learned the importance of attention to detail and naming conventions. Many times throughout this project I mistyped something without realizing and have to fish for the minor errors.
